<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi there! <br/><br/>
  I am Melisa, and right now I am majoring in Computer Science Year 2 undergraduate student at Nanyang Technological 
  University (NTU), Singapore. My most favorite subject in school is math, but in high school, I became interested 
  in programming because it had many of the same principles as math, so then I joined various competition that assess
  my skills in competitive programming, mainly in C++ language. I love programming so much that there are days when I spent
  my whole day just to code and code with no end. Thus, I enrolled in NTU's computer science degree. 
  In addition to doing well academically, I also enjoyed tutoring, organizing the structure of events.
</p>

<p>
  Looking at me now, I have mastered quite a lot of programming languages, such as C, C++, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, 
  JavaScript, React, and more to come! <br />
  I have also created many projects related.

<p>Gratefully, I am listed in Dean's List AY 2023-24 in my freshmen year in NTU. I am so glad that my hard work has been 
  paid off. I believe I am a dedicated, diligent and relentless person. I work hard to achieve my goal. I have set a 
  dream that I want to focus on during my university days and towards my career.
</p>

<p>I am passionate about web developer and AI. I look forward to my journey in diving into these two fields. I hope that
  by the end of my year 2 in university I can successfully grow and master these two fields that I am interested in.
