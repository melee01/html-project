<h2>My TOP 3 Movies of all times</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Pan (2015)</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie when I was in primary school. I have watched it approximately 10 times. It is SO GOOD!</p>
<h3>Hunter Killer (2018)</h3>
<p>I also like action movies. This one is SUPER DUPER RECOMMENDED. It it about submarine war between two countries.</p>
<h3>Maze Runner (2014)</h3>
<p>Yup, another action, sci-fi, adventure movie here. This one has an unrivaled storyline ever!</p>
